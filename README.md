## Azure Data Studio - lessons learned
I used to be a  **Query Analyzer** user, yet a lot of things have changed since then.
Now I am using Azure Data Studio and because of that I compiled a few keyboard shortcuts and also some related tips.
#### Shortcuts
- **(Ctrl + = )** For Zoom in.
- **(Ctrl + - )** For Zoom out.
- **(Ctrl + 0)** For Zoom reset.
#### Explain Button is missing
